     <p>Even outside of my research in physical 
oceanography, I am keenly interested in nature. 
Growing up in Acadia National Park, I spent many 
summer afternoons hiking and swimming in local 
spots. I learned to sail at a young age at the 
tutelage of my best friend's father and continued 
on to race sailboats in high school and during 
summers throughout college. During the summer of 
2012, I participated in a NOLS course, 
sea-kayaking Prince William Sound in Alaska; one 
of the most profound and exciting experiences I've 
had to date. if i keep typing here will the picture go where i want it to go? lalalalalalalalalalalallllllllllllalalalalalalalalalal
