     <p>Sea-surface height is a fundamental variable in 
physical oceanography and is one of few variables observable 
globally using satellite altimetry. Sea-surface height is a 
complicated manifestation of many processes both within and 
at the surface of the ocean, spanning a wide range of 
spatial and temporal scales, and as such is complicated and 
difficult to predict. This prediction, however, is necessary 
as anthropogenic emissions of fossil fuels leads to a 
changing climate and, invariably, a rising of the sea level. 
It is well known that tides are of first order importance in 
sea-surface height, but what about variability outside of 
this very narrow frequency band? To study the 
lower-frequency variability--the mesoscale phenomena and 
submesoscale phenomena--using satellite altimeters such as 
the <a href="http://swot.jpl.nasa.gov">Surface Water and 
Ocean Topography (SWOT)</a> satellite, the tides 
must first be accurately removed, as high-frequency signals 
such as tides are known to alias to lower frequencies and 
contaminate the temporally subsampled altimetry data. At 
high-frequencies, including the tidal band, internal tides 
and internal waves are also of great interest. To achieve 
this level of understanding of the internal wave continuum, 
both highly realistic ocean models and in-situ observations 
are used. In-situ observations provide real ocean data, 
while ocean models allow for global coverage. Aliasing of 
the internal wave continuum will also contaminate the lower 
frequency variability and must again be removed from the 
satellite data before study of the lower frequency 
variability begins, but the internal wave continuum is 
intrinsically of great interest as it is known to play a 
large role in ocean mixing. This ocean mixing is believed to 
participate greatly in the moderating of global temperature 
and has dissipated much of the excess carbon dioxide added to the climate 
system through human activity over the last century.</p>
