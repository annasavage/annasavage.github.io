    <h1>teaching</h1>
     <p>Previously, I have taught Physics 136, the 
laboratory cognate for Introductory Physics for 
Life Scientists. The laboratory section is 
intended to enhance the students' understanding of 
basic physics concepts that they are taught in 
lecture by allowing them hands-on experience and 
the opportunity to interact more closely with an 
instructor. In the laboratory section, we cover a 
variety of topics, ranging from uniform 
acceleration, to pulleys, to heating and cooling. 
The mathematics used in Physics 136 has a heavy 
tendancy towards statistics to better suit the 
career trajectories of the life science students, 
as opposed to the heavy calculus focus of other 
introductory physics classes.</p>
    <p>Outside of the formal classroom, I have also 
been able to involve myself with the University of 
Michigan chapter of <a 
href="https://maizepages.umich.edu/organization/swip">Society 
of Women in Physics (SWIP)</a> which is involved 
with various outreach projects. These outreach 
projects have provided me the opportunity to teach 
to younger and more impressionable students than the 
college students in my lab classes, which is often 
more challenging and much more energy intensive. </p>
