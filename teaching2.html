    <h1>teaching</h1>
    <p> My teaching methods are very interdisciplinary, as I try to draw on many different fields to connect with students from many different backgrounds. Oceanography, like other geological sciences, is a field that uses skills from a multitude of specilizations, from geochemistry, to microbiology, to computer science, and so on. To address this, I find it beneficial to draw on the backgrounds of individual students to help them feel more comfortable with the material. This grants students a level of confidence, which allows them to challenge themselves further with the material. I also feel passionately about inspiring students to become more skilled mathematicians. Students with strong backgrounds in math are able to use such skills in any field of science. </p>

    <p>Outside of the formal classroom, I was able to involve myself with the University of
Michigan chapter of <a
href="https://maizepages.umich.edu/organization/swip">Society
for Women in Physics (SWIP)</a> which is involved
with various outreach projects. These outreach
projects have provided me the opportunity to teach
to younger and more impressionable students than the
college students in my lab classes, which is often
more challenging and much more energy intensive. </p>
